fabric-loader
===========

Another attempt to port fabric-loader to forge, however it is capable of running some simple mods:
- [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/version/11.1.106+fabric) (11.1.106)
- [Dark Loading Screen](https://modrinth.com/mod/dark-loading-screen/version/1.6.14) (1.16.14)
- [Fadeless](https://modrinth.com/mod/fadeless/version/1.0.1) (1.0.1)
- [No Resource Pack Warnings](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-resource-pack-warnings/version/1.3.0) (1.3.0)
- [VTDownloader](https://modrinth.com/mod/vtdownloader/version/2.0.7+1.20.1) (2.0.7) - Localization and some textures don't work

TODO:
- Implement generation of mappings and some fixes for them (Now the file generated by arch-loom [mappings.tiny](https://github.com/dimadencep/fabric-loader/tree/master/minecraft/src/main/resources/mappings/mappings.tiny) is used)
- Implementation of mixin-fixer to fix bugs related to lambdas, etc.

Fabric mixins:
- To fix additional problems, replace the original mixin.jar (libraries/org/spongepowered/mixin/0.8.5/mixin-0.8.5.jar) file with this one: https://repo.constructlegacy.ru/public/com/github/dima_dencep/mods/sponge-mixin/0.13.0+mixin.0.8.5/sponge-mixin-0.13.0+mixin.0.8.5.jar

Install:
- Compile it on your computer and move `fabric-loader-0.14.21+local.jar` to the mods folder (only forge for 1.20.1 is currently supported)
